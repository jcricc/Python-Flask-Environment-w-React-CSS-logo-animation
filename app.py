#Additional Considerations:
#Gemini API Integration: You'll need to replace the placeholder logic with actual API calls to the Gemini service for converting text to PDF. This will involve crafting a request with your text data and handling the response.
#Google Drive Upload: After generating the PDF, you must upload it to Google Drive using the Google Cloud Storage Python Client. This involves authenticating with Google Cloud, creating a new file in Drive, and uploading the PDF data. After uploading, retrieve the shareable link of the PDF to return it to the frontend.
#Environment Configuration: Ensure your environment is properly configured with the necessary credentials for both the Gemini API and Google Cloud. This often involves setting up environment variables or a configuration file securely.
#This app.py provides a foundational structure for your Flask backend. You will need to fill in the integration specifics for both the Gemini API and Google Drive according to their respective documentation and your application's authentication setup.
