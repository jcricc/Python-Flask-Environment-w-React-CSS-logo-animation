### Python Flask, React, CSS3

Python Flask environment as a solid backend foundation and used React for the frontend to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. A standout feature Jack implemented is a CSS3 animation that makes the React logo energetically bounce around the screen, which adds an engaging visual effect and demonstrates proficiency with CSS keyframes and transforms.
